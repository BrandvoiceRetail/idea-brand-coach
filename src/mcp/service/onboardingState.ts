/**
 * Layer 1 (pure-ish logic) — onboarding state + playbook for `run_onboarding`.
 *
 * The coach calls `run_onboarding` when the user has NOT onboarded yet (no funnel
 * data) or asks to (re-)run onboarding, instead of the user pasting a prompt. This
 * module reads the caller's onboarding state (RLS-scoped) and returns the canonical,
 * ordered playbook the host then EXECUTES (the server cannot read Windsor itself —
 * the host pulls Windsor `get_data` and calls the ingest tools). One source of truth
 * for the onboarding workflow: the playbook lives here, not duplicated in a pasted
 * prompt or the always-on server instructions.

  '3) CONNECT + PULL PRIMITIVES (fast): check the user\'s Windsor connectors with get_connectors, then pull ONLY raw count/currency PRIMITIVES — never pre-computed rate columns.

DAILY granularity, source by source. SPEED: ASIN-grain reports are slow for Amazon to assemble — if a window times out, NARROW the window (try 30d, then 7d) and keep the column set minimal; backfill older history later. Inherently-rate signals with no count primitive (return_rate, repeat_rate, new_to_brand) may be pulled as provided. For relevant registered-but-off sources, offer get_connector_authorization_url rather than leaving a piece "—".',
  '4) MAP + STORE PRIMITIVES: map each primitive to a piece + journey_stage + metric_name (impressions→impressions, clicks→clicks, spend→spend, sessions→sessions, page_views→views, units_ordered→units_sold, order_items→orders, ordered_product_sales/revenue→revenue; plus return_rate/repeat_rate/new_to_brand where provided as fractions 0–1). DO NOT pull or store ctr, cvr, aov, acos or roas — the app DERIVES every rate from the primitives over the window (ctr=clicks/impressions, cvr=units÷sessions [Amazon unit-session %], aov=revenue/orders): correct window aggregation and far faster to pull. Ensure a campaign (list_campaigns / create_campaign), then store via ingest_campaign_analytics / ingest_funnel_analytics with campaign_id + brand_asset_id + journey_stage + source="windsor".
