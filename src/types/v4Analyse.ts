/**
 * Loop-2 (Analyse) shared domain types.
 *
 * WHAT: The single contract the Analyse screens (AnalyseRun, AvatarProfile,
 * GapDecisionTriggerPanel, DecisionBoard, MoveBriefClaimGate) and the
 * `analyseService` seam all import. Defining it once keeps the screens and the
 * integrator from drifting on field names.
 *
 * WHY: Loop-2 is the Diagnose→Analyse→Fix spine's "make sense of it" leg —
 * Avatar → Trust Gap + Decision Trigger → positioning Move → 7-slot Brief +
 * claim gate. Like Loop-1's read-it-back theatre, EVERY value here is grounded:
 * a `finding` exists only on a step that returned `ok`/`done`, scores come from
 * the real engines, and a claim is never asserted as fact unless confirmed.
 * Nothing on this surface is fabricated — the service returns `needs_input` or
 * `error` rather than synthesising a number, a move, or a claim.
 *
 * The run-step shape deliberately mirrors `src/types/onboardingReflection.ts`
 * (same five-state status union, same null-finding-until-done invariant) so the
 * two build-theatres share one mental model.
