/**
 * Loop-5 (Defend / "hold the gains") shared domain types.
 *
 * WHAT: The single contract the Defend screens (DriftWatchCard, DefendChecklist,
 * CompetitorTeaserCard, WorkbookExportCard) and the `defendService` seam import —
 * a Signature-drift watch (real `DriftItem[]` reused from Loop-3 Fix), a
 * deterministic defend checklist derived from real loop signals, and the
 * full-loop workbook export result.
 *
 * WHY: Defend is the Diagnose→Analyse→Fix→Re-measure→Defend spine's "keep what
 * you won" leg — watch for the brand drifting back open and file the proof.
 * Defining the contract once keeps the screens and the integrator from drifting
 * on field names.
 *
 * NO FABRICATION: every value is grounded.
 *  - Drift is the real `getDrift` read from Loop-3 (assets aligned to an older
 *    Signature) — never a made-up count.
 *  - The checklist `state` is computed from real reads (drift count, whether a
 *    second diagnostic run exists to confirm the lift); the competitor item is
 *    honestly `coming` because competitor reads are deferred in Alpha — it is
 *    NEVER shown as done/attention against invented competitor data.
 *  - The workbook export calls the live `export_workbook` engine; until that
 *    surface is wired it degrades to an honest error/needs_input, never a fake
 *    download.
 *
 * The result discriminant mirrors `FixResult`/`RemeasureResult` (same
 * ok | needs_input | error shape) so the service seams share one mental model.
