## Critical Path to MVP

### Must Have (Blocks Launch)
1. ❌ Stripe paywall (no revenue without this)
2. ❌ Training content pages (can't deliver course)
3. ❌ CAPTURE tool (major advertised feature)
4. ❌ PDF lead magnet (weak conversions without)

### Should Have (Brief Compliance)
5. ❌ Prompt router architecture
6. ❌ AI-generated Canvas/Avatar

### Nice to Have (Polish)
7. ⚠️ Tool suggestions from Coach
8. ⚠️ Document upload wiring
9. ⚠️ Admin prompt editing UI

---

## Recommended Approach

**Phase 1: Critical Monetization (6-8 hours)**
- Add Stripe paywall
- Add training content pages
- Add usage limits enforcement

**Phase 2: Critical Features (6-8 hours)**
- Build CAPTURE tool
- Add PDF generation for diagnostics
- Wire document uploads

**Phase 3: Architecture (Optional - defer to V2)**
- Build prompt router
- Migrate to database prompts
- Add tool suggestion logic

**Total for Viable MVP: 12-16 hours**

---

**Decision Point:** Confirm with Trevor which phases are mandatory for launch.
