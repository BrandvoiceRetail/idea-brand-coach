## Next: Brief Alignment Review

I've received your MVP Development Brief (v1.2) and will be reviewing it thoroughly to ensure everything aligns with your vision and requirements.

**What I'm Checking:**
- Monetization strategy (paywall, tiers, usage limits)
- Training content delivery system
- All core tools that need to be in the MVP
- Architectural requirements

**After My Review:**

I'll share a detailed analysis that includes:
1. **Alignment assessment** - What matches your brief perfectly vs. what needs adjustment
2. **Any gaps identified** - Clear breakdown of missing features or architectural differences
3. **Options for path forward** - Recommendations with effort estimates
4. **Clarifying questions** - Anything I need your input on (pricing, content links, etc.)

This review helps ensure we're 100% aligned before finalizing any remaining work.

## Managing Expectations

The app has strong technical foundations in place. My priority is making sure what's built matches your business objectives from the brief.

Based on initial review, the diagnostic and coaching features are solid, but I want to confirm all monetization and content delivery features match your requirements before we call it complete.

I'll get the analysis to you soon so we can discuss any adjustments needed.

Looking forward to making sure this delivers exactly what you need for your course and business model.

Best,
Matthew
